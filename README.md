# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

This project is part of my internship work at Prodigy InfoTech, where I performed **data analysis and visualization** using the Student Performance dataset. The goal was to gain insights into how gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation impact student scores in math, reading, and writing.
